<p> Every month in our anniversary we write Happy anniversary paragraphs to each other. The reason why we write paragraphs to each other because it shows how deeply in love we are and we show effort in our relationship. We always support each other with our ups and downs and with our dreams.I remember how we first met, we met in snapchat, My boyfriend added me randomly, we were stangers when we first met. When we first started texting each other we instanstly clicked, we fell in love with each other even though we didnt know much about each other. We than find out that we have the same mindset same and kinda the person. We both like the same things too.Later on we started playing role model. we play that so we can pretend that we are in the same countries and also neighbors. we started talking about how we wished to be in the same school, same country and all. haha later on after knowing each other pretty fast we started dating. I am so gald that he came to my life and making me so happy and the way he cares and loves me the way he do, nobody has ever loved me how did, even though we are far from each other we are so close. my baby boo has my heart and i have his, we promised each other that we will love one an other with all of our lifes, we wanna get married to one another and also grow old togther. i wish our dreams comes true and all the wishes that we made.
